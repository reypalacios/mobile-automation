            <h2 style="text-align:center"><strong>Subscription Agreement</strong></h2>
            <p>This Subscription Agreement (<strong>“Agreement”</strong>) is entered into by and between the subscriber (<strong>“Subscriber”</strong>) and Business Insider, Inc. (“BII”).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>GRANT OF RIGHTS.</strong> This Agreement grants Subscriber a non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-assignable subscription (<strong>“Subscription”</strong>) to use BII’s Business Insider Intelligence product, consisting of a web site and email service offering research reports, news notes, and an exhaustive library of charts and data on the mobile ecosystem <strong>(“Publication”</strong>). Each Subscription is personal to Subscriber and permits only Subscriber to access and receive content from the Publication.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SUMMARY OF SERVICES.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access:</strong> Subscriber will have access to the Publication.</li>
                <li><strong>Limitations: </strong>The Subscription does not permit forwarding or dissemination of any content externally from a Subscriber. This agreement expressly excludes auto-forwarding, manually forwarding emails or content, posting content on a website or intranet, or allowing for multiple individuals to access an individual account.<br>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Exceptions:</strong> Subscriber&rsquo;s ability to disseminate content is limited to the following:
                    <ol>
                        <li> Print and hand out copies of any portion of the content to colleagues or clients.</li>
                        <li> Use the report and any charts in the report in public presentations to colleagues<br>
                            or clients.</li>
                        <li> Post any charts (but ONLY charts) from the report online.<br>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    Such limited dissemination is granted ONLY to Subscribers who have paid in full for a Subscription. Individuals who are in an introductory trial period are expressly prohibited from any dissemination of content from Publication.<br>
                </li></ul>
            <br>
            <strong>TRIAL PERIOD. </strong>Individuals are entitled to only one free trial of the service. Any period of time beyond the maximum allowable amount of free trial days (14) will be billed as part of an actual subscription.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SERVICE TERM.</strong> The Subscription will be valid for 365 days from the date that Subscriber’s introductory trial period expired for the first year of service, and 365 days after prior renewal date for all subsequent years of service.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>BILLING.</strong> Subscriber shall be billed annually at the advertised rate for the Publication.  Payment shall be due immediately upon the conclusion of introductory trial period.  Accounts not paid within ten (10) days of the invoice date shall be considered delinquent, in which case BII reserves the right to suspend the Subscription until payment is received.  All active Subscriptions will be auto-renewed after the first 365 days at the publicly advertised price as determined by BII. Subscriber is entitled to cancel subscription at any point and receive a prorated refund based on the amount of time (in full months) left in the subscription.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>TERM AND TERMINATION.</strong> This Agreement takes effect immediately and remains in effect until Subscriber terminates subscription to Publication.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>COPYRIGHT.</strong> Subscribers acknowledge that the contents of the Publication are copyrighted by BII or its licensors and that neither Subscribers nor their employers where applicable hereby obtain rights whatsoever in the same. Except as described above, Subscribers shall not directly or indirectly reproduce, download or otherwise distribute (in print, electronic, or intranet format) material appearing on the site without prior written permission from BII.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>PRIVACY.</strong> To ensure electronic delivery accuracy and copyright compliance, BII may use tracking software, which may forward certain technical data and newsletter usage information from any computer that opens the newsletter email to BII. BII will not share this information with anyone outside the company unless required by law, nor will BII use it for any commercial purpose. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>GENERAL.</strong> Neither this Agreement nor any part or portion hereof shall be assigned or otherwise transferred by Subscriber without BII’s prior written consent.  Should any provision of this Agreement be held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, it shall be severed from this Agreement and the remaining terms shall remain in full force and effect.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of New York. All notices hereunder shall be sent, certified mail, to Business Insider, Inc. at 150 Fifth Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, NY, 10011, and to Subscriber at address given during initial signup.<br>
