Notwithstanding this, if you are a minor under the age of 18 years old and a Registered User you may request removal of your User Contributions posted on the Sites. To request removal of a User Contribution, you must notify us at feedback@<span class="skimlinks-unlinked">businessinsider.com</span>. When you contact Business Insider to request removal of a User Contribution, we require you to authenticate your status as a Registered User and to identify the particular User Contribution to be removed by providing the (1) URL to the User Contribution, (2) the date and time at which the User Contribution was posted, and (3) the contents of the User Contribution. If you do not properly notify us, authenticate your status as a Registered User, or properly identify the particular User Contribution to be removed, Business Insider is not required to remove your User Contribution and removal will be in our sole discretion.</p>
                                                    <p>Removal of User Contributions from the Sites does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of your User Contributions from the Sites.
